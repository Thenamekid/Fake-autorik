# Fake-autorik

In this project im trying to create a fake login screen to trick your shool admin.
Im planing on achiving this by your admin thinking this was Photoshop that you need to download for arts and crafts class.

You need to change the "Dom√§n: EDUAD" to your domain.
I belive I have added enoght instructions so that anyone with a litel bit of coding knolage can adjust anything to their chosing.

To get this up and runing you need to have python installd, you also need the py library Tkinter by (in cmd): pip istall Tkinter
Then you drag all the files in one folder and run the python script, and your done!

Also change the "ante - cbt", thats suposed to be your background img
