# Fake-autorik

In this project im trying to create a fake login screen to trick your shool admin.
Im planing on achiving this by your admin thinking this was GIMP that you need to download for arts and crafts class.

# Changes needed

You need to change the "Dom√§n: EDUAD" to your domain.
I belive I have added enoght instructions so that anyone with a litel bit of coding knolage can adjust anything to their chosing.

# Running

To get this up and runing you need to have python installd, you also need the py library Tkinter by (in cmd): pip istall Tkinter
Then you drag all the files in one folder and run the python script, and your done!

# EZ changes

Also change the "ante - cbt", thats suposed to be your background img.
The GIMP img is relly ez to change out 2!

If you want to not have the kinda bad GIMP downloader, then you can just remove the create_new_window triger.
If you want to change the text that appers when it fake downloads GIMP then you can change the "realsoundingwords.txt" folder.

# Additionaly

This program was made using chat-GPT (as a tool)
